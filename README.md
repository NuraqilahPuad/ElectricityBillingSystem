Electricity is the heart of today's world. And now the world is going to be digital so electricity is a very important aspect. Generation and supply of electricity is the primary task of the electricity board but it is also important to measure the power used by the consumer that is taking readings and generating the bills. In the current scenario taking a reading and generating bills is manual work. It is very time consuming. Power theft is one of the biggest problems. Sometimes customers did not pay the bills on time so the electricity board worker cut the power supply manually. In this case, sometimes corruption is done by the user or that worker which leads to the loss of the electricity board. In some areas meter reading tools are used to take a reading but it is a very complicated system and not so user-friendly. To avoid all these problems, we proposed a wireless system for smart electricity meters and a billing system
